#Instructions for devs

## Prerequisites
Before running the AH Bot, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3 installed on your system.

#### Necessary Dependencies:

- numpy
- OpenCV-Python (`cv2`)
- Pillow (`PIL`)
- pytesseract
- pyautogui
- keyboard

You can install these packages using pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python Pillow pytesseract pyautogui keyboard
```

## Instructions

1. **Open the Auction House (AH):** Before launching the script, make sure you have the Auction House opened on Dofus.

2. **Navigate to the Sells Tab:** Within the Auction House, navigate to the 'Sells' tab where your items for sale are listed.

3. **Ensure Prices are Visible:** Confirm that the item prices are fully visible on the screen once you select an item in your bags. The bot relies on screen reading to function correctly, so it's crucial that all relevant information is displayed and unobstructed.

4. **Launch the Bot:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the AH Bot files are located.
   - Run the command: `python3 main.py`

5. **Running the Bot:** Once the script is running, it will automate tasks within the 'Sells' tab of the Auction House. Ensure not to use the mouse or keyboard as it may interfere with the bot's operations.

## Important Notes

- **Interruption:** If you need to stop the bot for any reason, you can do so by pressing the designated stop key (e.g., 'F8') and keeping it pressed until the bot stop.
- **Safety:** Make sure you understand the actions performed by the bot. Use the AH Bot responsibly and at your own risk (I recommand selling mainly junk with it, and selling big items by hands).
- **Updates:** Keep the bot updated with the latest version for the best performance and new features.

## Troubleshooting

- If the bot doesn't seem to be working correctly, ensure that the Auction House screen hasn't changed and that all prices and necessary buttons are completely visible.
- Check that your Python environment is correctly set up with all necessary dependencies installed.
